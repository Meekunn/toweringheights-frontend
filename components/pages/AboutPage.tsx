					<Text mb={4} className="paragraph">
						Towering Heights Schools started as solace for office
						workers in the Alagbaka area with newborns to take care
						of. Our creche became a day home for the children we
						like to call “The First Five”. Since its opening in
						2017, THS has grown in number, facilities,and resources.
						From an established residence for the primary school, to
						a brand new computer room for the children to engage
						with.

						All these would not be possible without our parents that
						choose to bring their wards into our care.
